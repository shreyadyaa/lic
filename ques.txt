1. Architecture of Apache Airflow & Interaction in Docker

Scheduler:
Continuously monitors DAGs and determines which tasks need to run.
Pushes the tasks into a queue (depends on the executor used).

Executor:
The component responsible for running tasks.
It decides how tasks are distributed and executed: locally, in parallel, or across multiple workers.
Examples: SequentialExecutor, LocalExecutor, CeleryExecutor, KubernetesExecutor.

Worker:
Executes the actual task instances.
Can run locally (LocalExecutor) or distributed across multiple machines (CeleryExecutor).

Interaction in Docker Setup:

Each component usually runs in a separate container.

Scheduler container → Monitors DAGs → pushes tasks to Executor.
Executor container → Sends tasks to Workers.
Worker container(s) → Pick up tasks from the queue (like RabbitMQ/Redis) and execute them.

Metadata Database (Postgres/MySQL container) stores DAG states, task instances, logs, and other metadata.


2.
 It outlines the tasks that are performed, their sequence, and their timetable.

 Essential elements of a DAG file:

Imports: Include required Airflow classes and operators along with any Python modules.

Default Arguments: Define default behavior for tasks such as retries, start date, and dependencies on past tasks.

DAG Definition: The DAG object itself defines the workflow, its schedule, and description.

Tasks/Operators: Define individual tasks and their operations. Operators specify the type of task to execute.

Task Dependencies: Specify the order in which tasks should execute.

 3. Metadata persistence: Use a database container (like Postgres or MySQL) with volumes mapped to host storage to store DAG states, task instances, and logs references.

Log persistence: Map the Airflow logs folder to the host machine so logs remain available even if containers restart.

Importance: Persistence ensures that task history and logs are not lost on container restart, which is critical for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining workflow consistency.

4. LocalExecutor: Runs tasks in parallel on the same machine. Suitable for small workflows or single-container setups.

CeleryExecutor: Distributes tasks across multiple worker containers using a message broker like Redis or RabbitMQ. Suitable for large workflows that require horizontal scaling.

When to use which in Docker: LocalExecutor is simpler for development or testing, whereas CeleryExecutor is preferred in production for high availability and scalability.

5. The docker-compose.yaml file defines how Airflow components run as Docker containers. It specifies container services, networks, volumes, and environment variables, enabling multi-container orchestration.

Common services in this file:

Airflow Webserver: Provides the UI to monitor DAGs and tasks.

Scheduler: Monitors DAGs and schedules tasks.

Worker(s): Execute tasks, especially for CeleryExecutor setups.

Database: Stores metadata such as DAG states and task instances.

Message Broker: Required for CeleryExecutor (e.g., Redis or RabbitMQ).
